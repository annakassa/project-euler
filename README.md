# project-euler
This is one of my first mathematical programming challenges and I've decided to join Project Euler because it's a great way to improve my mathematical thinking and 
my programming skills, despite the fact that I need to learn how to maximise my ability to write algoritms. I strongly recommend this.
(P.S. it's fun when it's not being a total collapse of stress)
